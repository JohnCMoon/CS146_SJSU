Asymtotic Analysis
==================

### Review ###
Let's think about a binary search tree on a sorted array. How efficient is it vs a linear array?

- Linear: Best case 4 at [0], Worst 3n + 2
- Binary: Best case 4 at [mid], Worst 4log(n+4)

### Asymptotic Analysis ###
- Eliminate low order terms. Dominant term analysis comes in handy.
- Recall your properties of logarithms.

O is <=
Omega is >=
Theta is =
o is <
omega is >

### Order Notation ###
- Big-O: Upper bound: T(n) = O(f(n))
-- Exist constants c and n' such that T(n) <= cf(n) for all n >= n'

Example: g(n) = 1000n vs f(n) = n^2
- Is g(n) an element of O(f(n))?
-- Pick: n = 1000, c = 1
-- 1000n <= 1 * n^2 for all n >= 1000
-- So g(n) is an element of O(f(n))

### Algorithm Analysis Examples ###
Consider the following:
```Java
x := 0;
for i = 1 to N do
	for j = 1 to N do
		x := x + 1;
```
What's the value of `x` at the end? It's just `n^2`.

Cool. Now consider these two expressions. Which one grows faster?

`n^3 + 2n^2` vs `100n^2 + 1000`

`n^3` grows way faster! Dominant term analysis.

### Interview Question of the Day ###
- We're storing data for 100,000 restaurants. What is the restaurant with the best reccomendation?
- What questions can you ask? How can we do this?
- Now find the 30 best restaurants
- Now find the top N best restaurants

Well, for just one, we could do a simple linear or binary search algorithm.
For the top 30, it'd still be better to do just 30 searches vs actually sorting all 100,000.
For the top N, we'd want to use a heap that keeps the best at the top.
